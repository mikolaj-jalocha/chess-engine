## Chess Engine

This project implements a basic chess engine that uses the **MiniMax** algorithm for its AI player.

In the source code, several common **design patterns** such as **Singleton**, **Builder**, **Decorator**, and **Factory** are applied. Most classes are **immutable** and follow **OOP principles**. The project also takes advantage of useful Java 8 features like **Lambda expressions**, **Streams API**, and the **Optional** class.

### Libraries & Tools

- [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) – for immutable collections  
- **Java Swing** – for basic UI  
- **Maven** – as a build tool
